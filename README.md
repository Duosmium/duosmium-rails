# Duosmium (Rails Port)

We've received many requests for cool new features, 
and we really want to make them a reality - 
but Duosmium's old static build system just doesn't cut it. 
That's why we've created the next-generation Duosmium site,
built using the [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) framework.
Using a dynamic framework like Rails makes it easier to perform
operations on the fly and generate content, which means that
you can look at Science Olympiad in whole new ways using Duosmium.

*Still a work in progress!*
